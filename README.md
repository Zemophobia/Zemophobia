- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zemophobia
- 👀 I’m interested in ... gaming and starting my coding journey.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .. how to code through the Odin Community.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me ... github.
Part of me thinks I might be too old to start learning code, but I hope to at least give my all without procrastinating.
My current goals are to become profecient in Fullstack coding (new word for my vocabulary!) and dabble in coding games.
I hope you see a lot more of me in the future!
